## Description
This project simulates the management of different types of buildings through object-oriented programming, each subclass represents a different building, all have common properties and methods, but each also has their unique functionalities.
## Common Functions
- :door: Toggle Doors Closed/Open
- :bulb: Toggle Lights On/Off
- :icecream: Toggle Air Conditioning On/Off
## Unique Subclass Functions
- :book: **Library**: Borrow and return books. - by <ins>Mendoza Laurence</ins>
- :department_store: **Mall**: Browse stores, add products to a cart, and checkout with a budget. - by <ins>De Castro, Vinz Gabriel<ins>
- :books: **Research Lab**: Publish research and request lab equipment. - by <ins>Ponce, Jyvhan Earl</ins>
- :hamburger: **Canteen**: Order food, clean tables. - by <ins>Gupilan, Shanlee Yvonne</ins>.

The program uses object-oriented principles with an abstract base class (`Building`) and concrete implementations for each building type. Users interact via a command-line menu system.

## How to Run the Program
1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure Python is installed. You may install via their website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) or by typing "python" in the command line.
2. **Download the Script**: Save the provided `Group 7 - Building.py` file.
3. **Run the Script**:
   - Navigate to the directory where the downloaded script is located in.
   - Right-click the file -> open with Python to run the script.
4. **Follow the Menu Prompts**:
   - The script uses various menus to navigate between subclasses and it's features, use numbers to choose between the options presented to you.
   - Typing [0] will make the program go back to the previous menu,
   - Perform actions like toggling facilities, borrowing books, shopping, or ordering food.
